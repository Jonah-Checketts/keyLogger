# keyLogger
I wrote a program that can track your key presses
This program uses keyboard and string modules so you will need to pip install keyboard
you wont need to install string though because that is included with the install of python
This program tracks the keys the user presses and logs them into 2 text files
one that has things like backspace and space all spelled out
and one that is mutated to make it more easily readable to a user.
